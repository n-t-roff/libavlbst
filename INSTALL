1. Configuration

  The installation  paths  can  be  configured  in  the  makefile
  "in.mk".  There are three paths configureable:

     INCDIR   Directory for include files
     LIBDIR   Directory for library files
     MANDIR   Directory for man pages


2. Installation

  The library is build with the commands:

     $ ./configure
     $ make

  Installation usually has to be done as root:

     # make install

  Generated files are removed with

     $ make distclean


3. Deinstallation

  At first a makefile needs to be generated with

     $ ./configure

  Deinstallation is done as root with

     # make uninstall

  Then the generated makefile is removed with

     $ make distclean
